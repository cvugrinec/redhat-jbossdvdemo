This Repo contains stuff that I use during DV demos.

TwitterRestDemo;
created a rest service using the Twitter4J api to search for tweets regarding a certain topic. Output is in JSON, and can be used as a DV Source Model

vagrant-elk;
contains Vagrant sources in order to create a vagrant image for ElasticSearch Logstash and Kibana...I am planning this to use in a demo as well...this is copied from a third party

vagrant-oracle-postgres;
contains Vagrant sources in order to create a vagrant image for oracle and postgres running on CentOS... origin from 3rd party with only Oracle XE on it, I added the postgres installation to it.
Have not scripted the internet access for postgres via the pg_hba.conf yet
